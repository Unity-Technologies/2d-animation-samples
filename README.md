# 2D Animation Samples

This repository contains samples of the 2D Animation features to be used with Unity 2018.1 and newer.

## Getting Started
### Get the Unity Editor
To get started, download and install the latest Unity 2018.1,

These samples already include the necessary manifest in the Packages folder of the project.
If you want to activate these features in another project you may use the Package Manager to install them.

Find out more about packages here: **[Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@1.8/manual/index.html)**

### Preview Feature Documentation
* **[2D Animation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/2d-animation-samples/blob/master/Documentation/2DAnimation.md)**
* **[Inverse Kinematics (IK)](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/2d-animation-samples/blob/master/Documentation/2DIK.md)**

## Known Challenges:
* Using the Transform Tools for manipulating bones in the Scene while posing and animating is not as fluid as we would like
* The skinning and rigging portion is done in the Scene View along with Hierarchy manipulation and IK setups
