# 2D Animation

## Workflow

1. Select the Sprite in the **Sprite Editor**. 

2. Build the Sprite Bones hierarchy in the **[Bone Editor](#BoneEditor)** (menu: **Sprite Editor** > **Bone Editor**).

3. Generate and edit geometry, and assign skin weights in the **[Geometry and Weight Editor](#GeoEditor)** (menu: **Sprite Editor** > **Geometry And Weight Editor**).

4. Place the Sprite in a Scene and add the **[Sprite Skin](#SpriteSkin)** component to generate the bones of the Sprite.

5. The Sprite is now ready to be animated.

## <a id="BoneEditor"></a>Bone Editor

Create and define the bones for your Sprites and their hierarchy in the **Bone Editor**.

![Bone editor window](images/boneeditor.png)

## Create and Edit Bones

There are two tools for creating bones - the **Create Bone Tool**, and the **Create Free Bone** **Tool**. With both tools, the first bone created is the **Root** bone of the Sprite's bone hierarchy. However, both tools parent newly created bones differently. 

If no tools are selected, the **Bone Editor** is in **Transform** mode. In this mode, select and move any bone's *Pivot*, *Body* or *Tail* around to transform its length and size.

### Create Chain Bone tool

Select the **Create Bone** tool ![Create Bone icon](images/chainbonetool.png)and click anywhere in the Sprite to start creating a chain of bones. In **Create Chain Bone** mode, newly created bones are automatically parented to the previous bone in the hierarchy in a continuous chain. To deselect this tool, select **Esc**.

![Chain Bones](images/chainbones.png)	

### Create Free Bone tool

With the **Create Free Bone** tool, new bones are parented to the currently selected bone and ignores the bone chain hierarchy. This is useful if you need to create bones that do not form a continuous chain.

To create a new bone:

1. Select and highlight a bone to be the parent. If no bone is selected, the **Root** bone is the default parent.

2. Select the tool, then click an empty location to set the starting *Pivot* of the new bone.

3. Move the cursor to where the bone should end, and click to set the *Tip* of the bone. 

4. The new bone is created, parented to the bone selected in step 1.

### Free Move Tool

Use the **Free Move** tool to detach a bone from a chain and move it independently, however it is still treated as being parented to its original parent bone.

 ![Free Move tool](images/freemovetool.png)

### Parent Tool

The **Parent Tool** is used to change the parent of a child bone. First select the child bone, then select the **Parent Tool**, and finally select a bone to be the new parent.

![Parent tool](images/parentbonetool.png)

### Split Tool

The **Split Tool** will split a selected bone. First select a bone, then select the **Split Tool**. The selected bone will be split into two even length bones.

 ![Split Bone ](images/splitbonetool.png)

### Delete Tool

Select a bone, then click the **Delete Tool** to remove it.

## Bone Editor Shortcut Keys

|**Tool**|Shortcut|
|:---|:---|
|**Create Chain Bone**|B|
|**Create Free Bone**|N|
|**Free Move**|M|
|**Parent Bone**|P|
|**Split Bone**|S|
|**Delete**|Del|
|*To deselect all tools*|Esc|

## <a id="GeoEditor"></a>Geometry and Weight Editor

This editor is where Sprite geometry is generated, and vertex weights are then assigned to the bones to deform the geometry.

![Geo Weight editor](images/geowaiteditor.png)


### Generating Geometry Automatically

Sprite geometry can be generated automatically or created manually. 

To auto-generate the mesh, set the editor to *Geometry mode*.

![Auto-gen Geo button](images/Geometrymode.png)

Then select the *Generate* button at the top-left of the menu bar.

![Auto-gen Geo button](images/generatemesh.png)


Adjust the following parameters to refine the generated geometric mesh.

|Property|Function|
|:---|:---|
|**Outline Detail**|Density and accuracy of the mesh to the Sprite outline.|
|**Alpha Tolerance**|Threshold for transparency considered when generating the outline.|
|**Subdivide**|Subdivides the mesh to increase tessellation. Higher values increase the tessellation and complexity of the generated mesh.|

### Creating Geometry Manually

Create mesh geometry created manually in the **Create Vertex** or **Create Edge** modes., then double-click within a Sprite's  outline to select it.

 ![Geometry Mode select](images/createmesh.png)

From the top menu, select *Create Vertex* and click anywhere within the Sprite to create vertices. Then select *Create Edge* and click on vertices to connect them together to form new edges. Select *Split Edge* and then click on an edge to split it into multiple pieces.

You can create vertices and new edges directly in *Selection  mode* as well. While in *Selection mode*, double-click anywhere on the Sprite to create vertices. Hold *Shift* to connect a selected vertex to another to create an edge.

## Weights Mode

Select the *Weight  mode*, and then select a Sprite to begin applying skin weights. Click *Auto* ![Auto button](images/auto.png) to automatically generate weights based on the Sprite's bones, which can be edited manually later.

### Editing Skin Weights

The **Weight Editor** is used to manually edit skin weights. 

 ![Weight Editor](images/weighteditor.png)

There are two tools to edit the Weights - the *Slider* and the *Brush*. The *Slider* allows direct manipulation of the values of selected vertices; while the *Brush* tool allows you to 'paint' skin weights directly on the mesh.
### Weight Editor Settings

|Property|Function|
|:---|:---|
|**Mode**|Current behavior mode of the Weight Editor|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Add and Subtract**|Increases/Decreases influence on vertices around the selected bone|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Grow and Shrink**|Increases/Decreases influence on vertices that are already affected by the selected bone. |
|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Smooth**|Averages the weights of vertices with their neighbors, creating smoother deformations.|
|**Bone** (unavailable if *Mode: Smooth*)|Displays currently selected Bone. A different Bone can be selected via the drop-down menu.|
|**Normalize**| Enable to ensure the normalized weight of selected vertices is equal to 1.|
|**Amount**|Amount of weight applied on selected vertices|
|_*Following available in the Brush Weight editor only_|
|**Size**|Size of the brush cursor.|
|**Hardness**|Amount of weight applied by the brush. Higher values increase  the weight per brushstroke.|
|**Step**|Number of increments needed to apply the full weight of brush.|  

The weights for selected vertices can be viewed and further adjusted with the vertex inspector located at the bottom-left of the Editor window.

![Weight inspector](images/weightinspector.png)

You can preview the effect of the painted weights within the **Sprite Editor**. Select and hold a bone to move or rotate it. The Sprite's geometry mesh deforms according to the weights painted. Releasing the bones resets them and the mesh back to their original state.

## <a id="SpriteSkin"></a>Sprite Skin Component

The **Sprite Skin** component is needed for the bones to deform the Sprite mesh in the Scene.  
![Sprite Skin component](images/spriteskincomponent.png)  

1. Drag and drop the Sprite Asset onto the Scene after its bones, geometry, and weights have been are set-up in the **Sprite Editor**. 
2. Add the **Sprite Skin** component to the  Sprite. 
3. Click **Create Bones** to generate the bone hierarchy of the Sprite in the Scene.
 
![Bone hierarcy in Scene](images/bonehierarchy.png)

Select and hold a bone to pivot it around its head and deform the Sprite's mesh directly in the Scene to begin animating it.

![Plunkah Deform](images/PlunkahDeform.png)

*Shift+click* to select multiple bones at once. Moving selected bones together deforms the mesh across all of them.

![Plunkah chain deform](images/PlunkahChainBoneDeform.png)

Bones that are not directly chained together can also be selected and moved together.  Areas of the mesh influenced by the *unselected* bones are not deformed.  

![Plunkah free bone deform](images/PlunkahFreeBoneDeform.png)


Select and hold the head of a bone to detach it from the previous bone in the chain, the mesh will deform accordingly.  

![Plunkah detached deform](images/PlunkahDetachedDeform.png)

Use the standard **Transform** tools to deform the Sprite's geometry mesh for greater precision. Note that the **Rect Transform** tool *cannot* be used to transform the bone gizmos.

end.
